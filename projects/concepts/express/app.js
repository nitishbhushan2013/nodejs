/* Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

// It is called by app.use which takes just one function and accept three parameters - request, response and next
// call next to handover call to next middleware function
app.use((req, res, next)=>{

})
*/

//this middleware will help us to display maintenance page beforfe serving any other request . 
// Great way to use middleware
