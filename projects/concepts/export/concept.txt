/*
In the Node.js module system, each file is treated as a separate module. 
module.exports is the object that's actually returned as the result of a require call.




When dividing your program code over multiple files, module.exports is used to publish variables and functions to the consumer of a module. The require() call in your source file is replaced with corresponding module.exports loaded from the module.

Remember when writing modules

Module loads are cached, only initial call evaluates JavaScript.
It's possible to use local variables and functions inside a module, not everything needs to be exported.
The module.exports object is also available as exports shorthand. But when returning a sole function, always use module.exports.

Condition:
if you overwrite exports then it will no longer refer to module.exports. So if you wish to assign a new object (or a function reference) to exports then you should also assign that new object to module.exports

exports is just the reference of module.exports

exports = module.exports = fucntion_module = () =>{
    //....
}
- Setting module.exports allows the fucntion_module function to be called like a function when required. Simply setting exports wouldn't allow the function to be exported because node exports the object module.exports references. 
- They set both module.exports and exports to ensure exports isn't referencing the prior exported object. By setting both you use exports as a shorthand and avoid potential bugs later on down the road.

Using exports.prop = true instead of module.exports.prop = true saves characters and avoids confusion.


BAD EXAMPLE
exports = 'william';

exports = function(){
     //...
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const _ = require("lodash.js")

// Node module seaerching mechanism :
    - Node first look into core module for this file 
    - If not found, then it then recursively look into node_modules for the file


Before srarting the project 
- create a top layer folder and run 'npm init'
    -- this will create package.json. Thsi file holds all the package dependencies details
npm install
- we can use it to export any third party library or module into our application
- it download the file into node_modules folder 

exm: 
npm install lodash --save 
// --save command would save the file version details into package.json. 

After getting the project from the GITHUB
- run npm install 
    -- This will read package.json and download all the dependent modules into node_modules
