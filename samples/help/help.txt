problem 
========
When after installing package, you woule not be bale to use the module 
    Error: Cannot find module 'mongoose'

Soluition
--------------
You can do either of two things to make it run :-

1) Install mongoose globally with below steps :-

a)npm install mongoose -g 

b) Go to your app directory, where bot.js is located and then run

npm link mongoose 

Explanation :- When you install a package globally via npm, it is downloaded to global node_module folder. For me(Mac user), it's under /usr/local/lib/node_modules/mongoose. We link this to that directory from where you are trying to run module.js.

2) Another approach is to install mongoose locally, not globally via

npm install mongoose
